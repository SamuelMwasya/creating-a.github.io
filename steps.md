Creating a GitHub Pages website, which ends with the suffix ".github.io," is a simple process that involves the following steps:

- Sign up for a GitHub account: Go to the GitHub homepage (https://github.com/) and click on the "Sign up" button. Follow the instructions to create your account.

- Create a new repository: Once you have created your account, click on the "+" icon in the top right corner of the screen and select "New repository" from the dropdown menu.

- Name your repository: Give your repository a name that ends with ".github.io". For example, if you want your website to be called "mywebsite", the repository name should be "mywebsite.github.io".

- Choose your repository settings: Leave the repository set to "Public" (unless you want to pay for a private repository), and don't check the box that says "Initialize this repository with a README".

- Create your repository: Click the "Create repository" button.

- Upload your website files: Once your repository is created, you can start uploading files to it. You can upload HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files, as well as images and other assets.

- Set up your website: In order to make your website visible, you need to create a new file called "index.html" in your repository. This file should contain the code for your homepage.

- Publish your website: Once you've created your index.html file, your website is ready to be published. To do this, go to your repository's settings, scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section, and select the "master branch" as your publishing source. Then click "Save".

- Access your website: Once your website has been published, you can access it by going to "username.github.io/repositoryname". In our example, this would be "myusername.github.io/mywebsite".

Congratulations, you've now created a GitHub Pages website!
